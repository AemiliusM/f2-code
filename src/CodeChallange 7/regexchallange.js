// export const sortByChildren = (charArray) => {
 
// };I am super unsure of how to even start with regex but I would try to map through each house 
//and get the number of children and then sort by number a - b if a === b house.name sort a - b, push into a new array and return it


// export const containsW = (str) => {
//  const thing = 'w';  if (str.map(char => char === thing) {
//     return true
// }
// }; I gave this one a while and I am super stummped
